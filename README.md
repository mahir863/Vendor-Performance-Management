# Vendor-Performance-Management
Effective inventory and sales management are critical for optimizing profitability in the retail and wholesale industry. Companies need to ensure that they are not incurring losses due to inefficient pricing, poor inventory turnover, or vendor dependency. The goal of this analysis is to:

*	Identify underperforming brands that require promotional or pricing adjustments.
*	Determine top vendors contributing to sales and gross profit.
*	Analyse the impact of bulk purchasing on unit costs.
*	Assess inventory turnover to reduce holding costs and improve efficiency.
*	Investigate the profitability variance between high-performing and low-performing vendors.

This project follows an end-to-end analytics workflow that transforms raw data into actionable insights:

* Clearly define the business problem and analytical objectives.

* Explore raw database tables using SQL, perform joins, handle missing values, and clean inconsistencies.

* Create an aggregated, analysis-ready table aligned with business metrics.

* Persist the aggregated data back into the database for reusability and consistency.

* Load the aggregated table into a Jupyter Notebook for further analysis.

* Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and validation using Python.

* Answer key research and business questions through structured analysis.

* Analyze and interpret insights to identify trends and patterns.

* Build an interactive dashboard in Power BI for stakeholder consumption.

* Summarize findings and recommendations through structured report writing.
